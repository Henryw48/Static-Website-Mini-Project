      <h2>How to play Chess</h2>
      <p> During my free time, I would sometimes play chess. I am pretty decent at chess and can
        probably teach beginners how to play. Below are some of the chess pieces and their abilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>King - You want to protect your king. He can move 1 square at a time in any direction.</li>
        <li>Queen - Your queen is op. She can move in any direction by moving as many squares as you want.</li>
        <li>Rook - Your rook can only move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as you want.</li>
        <li>Bishop - Your bishop can move diagonally as many spaces as you want</li>
        <li>Knight - Your knight can move in any L shape. It can jump over other pieces as long as the square you end up in is empty.</li>
        <li>Pawn - Your pawn at the starting position can move vertically either 1 or 2 spaces. If there is an enemy piece that is diagonal
          from your pawn and is in the range of 1 space, then your pawn can claim that space. Another special ability that the pawn has is
          that if it reaches the end of the board, then you can exchange your pawn with a queen.
        </li>
      </ul>
