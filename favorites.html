          <h2>Sports</h2>
          <p>
            One of my favorite sports is basketball. I used to play a lot during middle school with friends even though I
            wasn't that good. I could probably work on my shooting form and handles, but I haven't played much cause of
            work overload. I also like to play volleyball. The main reason I got into volleyball was because I watched an
            anime called "Haikyu!!". I really like playing up front defending and spiking.

          <h2>Gaming</h2>
          <p>
            I love playing games during my free time. One thing I like about gaming is when my teammates
            are screaming at each other to do better. Some games I play are counterstrike, valorant, roblox, osu,
            and occasionally fortnite. Gaming is just not about winning. It's the moments of exploring and collaborating
            which makes the game fun.
