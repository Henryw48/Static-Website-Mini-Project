        <h2>Central Park</h2>
        <p class="item">
            Central park is one of the biggest parks that I have ever been to. There is just so much to explore, however you can easily get lost. I
            recommend you have either your friends or family if you decide to visit.

        <h2>High Line</h2>
        <p class="item">
            The high line is such a cool experience. There are such amazing views to see and if you are hungry or want to shop, then there is a mall
            nearby to satisfy all your needs and wants. I have went to the highline twice and both times were very fun.

        <h2>Little Island</h2>
        <p class="item">
            Little Island is near the highline and it is basically a vessel. It is a man made island that has great
            scenery, perfect for taking high quality photos. I went with my sister and we took alot of photos together.
